Dimensionality Reduction

Process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration

Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension. Working in high-dimensional spaces can be undesirable for many reasons; raw data are often sparse as a consequence of the curse of dimensionality, and analyzing the data is usually computationally intractable. Dimensionality reduction is common in fields that deal with large numbers of observations and/or large numbers of variables, such as signal processing, speech recognition, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics.[1]

Methods are commonly divided into linear and nonlinear approaches.[1] Linear approaches can be further divided into feature selection and feature extraction.[2] Dimensionality reduction can be used for noise reduction, data visualization, cluster analysis, or as an intermediate step to facilitate other analyses.

Dimensionality Reduction is a critical technique in data science and machine learning that simplifies complex datasets by reducing the number of variables while retaining the essential information. This process is crucial for improving model performance, speeding up computations, and reducing the risk of overfitting.
